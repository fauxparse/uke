      <div>Like when you said you felt so happy you could die</div>
      <div>Told myself that you were right for me</div>
      <div>But felt so lonely in your company</div>
      <div>But that was love and it’s an ache I still remember</div>

    <section rel="verse">
      <div>You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness</div>
      <div>Like resignation to the end, always the end</div>
      <div>So when we found that we could not make sense</div>
      <div>Well you said that we would still be friends</div>
      <div>But I’ll admit that I was glad that it was over</div>

      <div><span title="Dm">But you </span><span title="C">didn’t have to </span><span title="B♭">cut me </span><span title="C">off</span><span title="…"></span></div>
      <div>Make out like it never happened and now we were nothing</div>
      <div>And I don’t even need your love</div>
      <div>But you treat me like a stranger and I feel so rough</div>
      <div>No you didn’t have to stoop so low</div>
      <div>Have your friends collect your records and then change your number</div>
      <div>I guess that I don’t need that though</div>
      <div>Now you’re just somebody that I used to know</div>
      <div>Now you’re just somebody that I used to know</div>
      <div>Now you’re just somebody that I used to know</div>

    <section rel="verse">
      <div>Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over</div>
      <div>But had me believing it was always something that I’d done</div>
      <div>But I don’t wanna live that way</div>
      <div>Reading into every word you say</div>
      <div>You said that you could let it go</div>
      <div>And I wouldn’t catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know</div>
